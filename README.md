In the Git hub, i have learned a few processes and stages to follow as listed below,

Create Git hub Account, with your name and Email

Create a new repository,with README FILE give it a tittle and descriptions

You go to code and copy the links

You choose where you want to save your repository folder in your local computer

After this stage you have already installed the Git bash and Visual Studio Code in your computer

You can now open the folder of the repository you created with Git bash ,automatically it create your folder

Open the folder, inside the folder is where you will get README FILE

You will open the README File with Visual Studio Code automatically it will displace it

For you to paste the links copied from above, you need to type git space clone space and paste the link

From here you can type in your content, save it and group before you commit 

After finishing you synchronise the changes automicatlly it will displace in your github

I also learned about creating a branch and repeat the above stages to make changes

I did learnt about Git hub pages creating a simple website linked to the Git hub which i can used publish my pages with very intresting themes that are already created in the in the git.
